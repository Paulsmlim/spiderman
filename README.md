Spiderman vs Robots

Creator: Paul Seung Mo Lim


This is a game I programmed using Java. I used Greenfoot IDE, which can be downloaded here: https://www.greenfoot.org/download.


Most of the code in this program are in the following packages/classes: Spiderman, Enemies (Robot1, Robot2, Robot3, BoltRobot), Robot3Bolt, BoltRobotBolt, Web


Other classes include Worlds or objects that mostly serve to interact with the above classes in different worlds.
