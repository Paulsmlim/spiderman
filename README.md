Spiderman vs Robots

Creator: Paul Seung Mo Lim


This is a game I programmed through Greenfoot using the language Java. The classes in the respository must be compiled through Greenfoot which can be downloaded here: https://www.greenfoot.org/download.

Most of the code in this program are in these classes:
  Paul
  Robot1
  Robot2
  Robot3
  BoltRobot
  Robot3Bolt
  BoltRobotBolt
  Web
  
Other classes include Worlds or objects that mostly serve to interact with the above classes in different worlds.
